# Stack-Clone

Hello!

This project is a clone of the popular mobile game "Stack" that I created using the Unity game engine. The purpose of this project was to experiment with different mechanics in Unity and also practice making a fun game.
Unity 2021.3.2f1

## About Game
"Stack" game, your goal is to stack different-sized cubes together to create the highest tower possible. The position and size of the cubes may vary at each level, so you need to be careful and place them correctly. The excess parts on the edges of the cubes may need to be cut, which can make the game a bit more challenging. Try this fun game to see how high of a tower you can build!

This project was developed using the Unity game engine and the C# programming language. The game's models used simple objects in Unity, based on a simple concept trying to align the cubes coming from the right and left according to the cube under it.
